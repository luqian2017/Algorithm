20. Dices Sum

Throw n dices, the sum of the dices' faces is S. Given n, find the all possible value of S along with its probability.

Example
Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: [[1, 0.17], [2, 0.17], [3, 0.17], [4, 0.17], [5, 0.17], [6, 0.17]]
Explanation: Throw a dice, the sum of the numbers facing up may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and the probability of each result is 0.17.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: [[2,0.03],[3,0.06],[4,0.08],[5,0.11],[6,0.14],[7,0.17],[8,0.14],[9,0.11],[10,0.08],[11,0.06],[12,0.03]]
Explanation: Throw two dices, the sum of the numbers facing up may be in [2,12], and the probability of each result is different.
