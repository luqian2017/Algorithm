406. Minimum Size Subarray Sum
Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a subarray of which the sum ≥ s. If there isn't one, return -1 instead.

Example
Given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7, the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

Challenge
If you have figured out the O(nlog n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n).
