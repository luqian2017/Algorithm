57. 3Sum

Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Example
Example 1:

Input:[2,7,11,15]
Output:[]
Example 2:

Input:[-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output:	[[-1, 0, 1],[-1, -1, 2]]
Notice
Elements in a triplet (a,b,c) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a ≤ b ≤ c)

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
