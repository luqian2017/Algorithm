528. Flatten Nested List Iterator

Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Example
Example1

Input: list = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
Example2

Input: list = [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: [1,4,6]
Notice
You don't need to implement the remove method.
