246. Binary Tree Path Sum II
中文English
Your are given a binary tree in which each node contains a value. Design an algorithm to get all paths which sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go in a straight line down.

Example
Example 1:

Input:
{1,2,3,4,#,2}
6
Output:
[
  [2, 4],
  [1, 3, 2]
]
Explanation:
The binary tree is like this:
    1
   / \
  2   3
 /   /
4   2
for target 6, it is obvious 2 + 4 = 6 and 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
Example 2:

Input:
{1,2,3,4}
10
Output:
[]
Explanation:
The binary tree is like this:
    1
   / \
  2   3
 /   
4   
for target 10, there is no way to reach it.
