12. Min Stack
Implement a stack with min() function, which will return the smallest number in the stack.

It should support push, pop and min operation all in O(1) cost.

Example
push(1)
pop()   // return 1
push(2)
push(3)
min()   // return 2
push(1)
min()   // return 1
Notice
min operation will never be called if there is no number in the stack.
