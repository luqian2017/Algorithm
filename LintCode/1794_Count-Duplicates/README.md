Description

Given an array of integers, your task is to find the duplicate numbers in the array.
Your program should return all duplicate numbers and order them **in order of where they started repeating**.
For example, the array [5,1,2,2,1,1] has two duplicate digits,`1` and `2`.
The number `1` repeats at index 4, and the number `2` repeats at index 3, so your program should return `[2, 1]`, because the 2 repeats before the 1 repeats.

Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
Output: [2, 3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3]
Output: []
```
