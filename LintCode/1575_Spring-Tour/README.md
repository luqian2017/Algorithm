There are `n` group children ready to go on a spring tour. The array `a` indicates the number of people in each group. There are no more than four people in each group. There are now several cars. Each car can only take up to four people. The same group of children must sit in the same car, and each car need't be full. How many cars do you need at least to meet the travel needs of children？

0≤*n*≤1*e*4
1≤*a*[*i*]≤4

Example

**Example1**

```
Input: a = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
At this time, there are 4 people in the fourth group, sitting alone in a car.
The first group has 1 person, the third group has 3 people, and just 4 people get for one car.
The second group of 2 people has a single car, so at least 3 cars are needed.
