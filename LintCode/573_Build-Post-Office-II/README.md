573. Build Post Office II

Given a 2D grid, each cell is either a wall 2, an house 1 or empty 0 (the number zero, one, two), find a place to build a post office so that the sum of the distance from the post office to all the houses is smallest.

Return the smallest sum of distance. Return -1 if it is not possible.

Example
Example 1:

Input：[[0,1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,2,1],[0,1,0,0,0]]
Output：8
Explanation： Placing a post office at (1,1), the distance that post office to all the house sum is smallest.
Example 2:

Input：[[0,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,0]]
Output：4
Explanation： Placing a post office at (1,1), the distance that post office to all the house sum is smallest.
Challenge
Solve this problem within O(n^3) time.

Notice
You cannot pass through wall and house, but can pass through empty.
You only build post office on an empty.
