229. Stack Sorting
中文English
Sort a stack in ascending order (with biggest terms on top).

You may use at most one additional stack to hold items, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure (e.g. array).

You don't need to return a new stack, just sort elements in the given parameter stack.

Example
Given stack =

| |
|3|
|1|
|2|
|4|
 -
After sort, the stack should become:

| |
|4|
|3|
|2|
|1|
 -
The data will be serialized to [4,2,1,3]. The last element is the element on the top of the stack.

Notice
O(n^2) time is acceptable.
