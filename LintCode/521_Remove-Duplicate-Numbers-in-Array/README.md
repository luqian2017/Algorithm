521. Remove Duplicate Numbers in Array
中文English
Given an array of integers, remove the duplicate numbers in it.

You should:

Do it in place in the array.
Move the unique numbers to the front of the array.
Return the total number of the unique numbers.
Example
Example 1:

Input:
nums = [1,3,1,4,4,2]
Output:
[1,3,4,2,?,?]
4
Explanation:

Move duplicate integers to the tail of nums => nums = [1,3,4,2,?,?].
Return the number of unique integers in nums => 4.
Actually we don't care about what you place in ?, we only care about the part which has no duplicate integers.
Example 2:

Input:
nums = [1,2,3]
Output:
[1,2,3]
3
Challenge
Do it in O(n) time complexity.
Do it in O(nlogn) time without extra space.
Notice
You don't need to keep the original order of the integers.
