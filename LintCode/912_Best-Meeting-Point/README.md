Description

A group of two or more people wants to meet and minimize the total travel distance. You are given a 2D grid of values `0` or `1`, where each `1` marks the home of someone in the group. The distance is calculated using [Manhattan Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.

Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[[1,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
Output:
6

Explanation:
The point `(0,2)` is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance of `2 + 2 + 2 = 6` is minimal. So return `6`.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
[[1,1,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,1]]
Output:
14
```
