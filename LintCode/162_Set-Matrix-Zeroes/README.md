162. Set Matrix Zeroes

Given a m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in place.

Example
Example 1:

Input:[[1,2],[0,3]]
Output:[[0,2],[0,0]]
Example 2:

Input:[[1,2,3],[4,0,6],[7,8,9]]
Output:[[1,0,3],[0,0,0],[7,0,9]]
Challenge
Did you use extra space?
A straight forward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
Could you devise a constant space solution?
