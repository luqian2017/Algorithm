488. Happy Number
中文English
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example
Example 1:

Input:19
Output:true
Explanation:

19 is a happy number

    1^2 + 9^2 = 82
    8^2 + 2^2 = 68
    6^2 + 8^2 = 100
    1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1

Example 2:

Input:5
Output:false
Explanation:

5 is not a happy number

25->29->85->89->145->42->20->4->16->37->58->89
89 appears again.
